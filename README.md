# CRV-linked-list-matrix
THIS IS A SIMULATION PROGRAM.
HERE WE ARE SHOWING HOW WE CAN OPTIMIZE THE USAGE OF SPARSE MATRICES USING CRV LINKED LIST DATA STRUCTURE.
CRV STANDS FOR COLUMN, ROW, VALUE.
THE ASSUMPTION HERE IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF STANDARD ELEMENTS (MOSTLY WITH THE VALUE OF 0).
IN ORDER TO SAVE SOME SPACE, AND MAKE INSERTION AND DELETION OF ELEMENTS EASIER AND MORE EFFICIENT, WE USE LINKED LIST REPRESENTATION.
THE SPACE WILL BE SAVED IN MORE SIGNIFICANT QUANTITIES AS THE NUMBER OF COLUMNS AND ROWS GROWS.
AT THE END OF THE SOURCE.C FILE YOU WILL AN EXAMPLE WHERE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MEMORY OCUPATION IS SIGNIFICANT.
